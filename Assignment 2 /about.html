            <p>I've been tasked to write three paragraphs of text for this assignment, and I'm guessing that means three seperate lines of code and not proper blocks of text.</p>
            <p>My coding skills aren't exactly perfect, although I'm not completely new to this. After having already had a month of Python in TDT4110 I know a bit; however, that's the wrong language for this course.</p>
            <p>When it comes to my expectations of the course, I'm not really sure what to expect. From what I've read and heard I should be able to make an entire website by the end of the course; which sounds exciting!</p>
       
            <h2>Questions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In client server architechture, the client requests packets from a server. The server will accept the packet request and send the correlating packets back to the client.</li>
                <li>The client in this scenario requests the needed packets.</li>
                <li>An IP address is a unique number consisting of four parts, each part being a number ranging from 0 to 255. Each computer has it's own address.</li>
                <li>Domain Name System (DNS) is used to reroute domains to the correlating IP address when browsing the web. When you as a client send a request to go to a website, for example ntnu.no a DNS server will reroute you to the correct IP address the webpage is stored on so that you can see it.</li>
                <li>Unlike the World Wide Web which is what webpages you visit and read online, the internet is what carries the information around as an infrastucture. The internet consist of connected computers and servers.</li>
                <li>Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is the standard language for writing the skeleton of webpages. Just like what I'm doing right now in said language. To style the backbones made up of HTML we can use CSS and JavaScript.</li>
